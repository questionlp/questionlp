# Howdy!

My name is Linh Pham (he/him) and I am the person behind the
[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me). I am also an
IT/DevOps Engineer that works on automating and orchestrating applications.

Python is my it thing when it comes to programming or playing around with the
data that I've collected over the years from
[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org). I still dabble around
in C#, PHP and JavaScript when I have chance to do so. I definitely want to
play around with Swift and Go when I have the free cycles.

In my pinned repos, you'll find the code for the Stats Page and supporting/related
projects.
