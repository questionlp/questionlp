# Howdy!

My name is Linh Pham (he/him) and I am the person behind the
[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me). I am also an
IT/DevOps Engineer that works on automating and orchestrating applications.

Python is my it thing when it comes to programming or playing around with the
data that I've collected over the years from
[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org). I still dabble around
in C#, PHP and JavaScript when I have chance to do so. I definitely want to
play around with Swift and Go when I have the free cycles.

### Library

Version 2 of the Wait Wait Stats Library has been released; which, includes a
complete refactor and restructuring. The new version requires Python 3.8 or
higher. Development of the previous library will be limited to fixing any
significant data retrieval or calculation issues.

 * Version 2: [wwdtm](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm) **(Current Version)**
 * Version 1: [libwwdtm](https://github.com/questionlp/libwwdtm)

Documentation for version 2 of the Stats Library is available at
[docs.wwdt.me](https://docs.wwdt.me).

### Database Schema

The data that I've collected is stored in a MariaDB/MySQL database and I've
published the schema for it in its own repo.

 * [wwdtm_database](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm_database)

### Database Export

A Python program has been created to export the contents of each table in the
Wait Wait Stats Database as individual JSON files.

 * [wwdtm_database_export](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm_database_export)

### Slugify Names

A Python program has been created to generate slug strings for guests, hosts,
locations, panelists and scorekeepers, which are used throughout the libraries
and applications listed above.

 * [wwdtm_slugify](http://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm_slugify)

### Previous Versions

Versions 2 and 3 of the Stats Page were developed in PHP, with version 3 using
the now deprecated [Silex](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex) framework. I've
published the code in case anyone is interested at looking at the progression
of the Stats Page over the years.
