# Howdy!

My name is Linh Pham (he/him) and I am the person behind the [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me). I am also an IT/DevOps Engineer that works on automating and orchestrating applications.

Python is my it thing when it comes to programming or playing around with the data that I've collected over the years from [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org). I still dabble around in C#, PHP and JavaScript when I have chance to do so. I definitely want to play around with Swift and Go when I have the free cycles.

### Sites

The current version of the Stats Page, Graphs and Reports web applications are developed in Python and built top of the [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) micro web app framework. The Stats API is developed in Python and built on top of [FastAPI](http://fastapi.tiangolo.com).
